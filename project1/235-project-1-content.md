### Mechanics
The player can run, jump, sweep with their broom, grab a bucket to mop, and flip off customers to bounce their complaints back at them or else they are stunned for a few seconds
### Control
You use purely a keyboard, with either arrow keys or WASD to move, U to sweep/mop, I to grab the bucket, O to flip off the customers, and P to pause the game
### Onboarding
The game starts with a screen where you choose whether you're using WASD or arrow keys, with the rest of the actions displayed there. You are then shown a screen giving the basic mechanics of the game
### Player Learning
The player has to learn how to manage their time, as each action will take a certain amount of time. This means that the skill curve is based around the player's sense of prioritization and task management on the fly
